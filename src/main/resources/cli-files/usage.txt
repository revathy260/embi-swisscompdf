Swisscom AIS Client ${versionInfo}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: ./bin/ais-client.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
    -init                                               - Create sample configuration files in the current folder

    -input [FILE]                                       - Source PDF file to sign. You can use this parameter several times, to sign multiple
                                                          documents at once. Using multiple inputs forces the usage of suffix (see below) as it is
                                                          difficult to give both the input and the output files as parameters.

    -output [FILE]                                      - Output PDF file, where the signed document should be written. This parameter can be
                                                          used only when one single input is given. For more than one input, use suffix.

    -suffix [SUFFIX]                                    - Suffix for output file(s), composed using the input file plus the suffix, as alternative to
                                                          specifying the output file entirely. Default is "signed-#time", where "#time" is replaced
                                                          with current time (hhMMss).

    -type [static|ondemand|ondemand-stepup|timestamp]   - The type of signature to create

    -config [PROPERTIES FILE]                           - The properties file that provides the extra configuration parameters. Use -init to create a sample file. If you don't specify a file, by default config.properties is used

    -help                                               - This help text

    -v                                                  - Be verbose about what is going on (sets Logback config to info)

    -vv                                                 - Be EXTRA verbose about what is going on (sets Logback config to debug, without HTTP and TLS traffic)

    -vvv                                                - Be EXTRA-EXTRA verbose about what is going on (sets Logback config to debug, with HTTP and TLS traffic)

Use cases:
    1. > ./bin/ais-client.sh -init   => Have the config files generated for you in the current folder
    2. Edit the files accordingly
    3. > ./bin/ais-client.sh -type timestamp -config config.properties -input fileIn.pdf -output fileOut.pdf
    4. > ./bin/ais-client.sh -type timestamp -input file1.pdf -input file2.pdf -input file3.pdf
